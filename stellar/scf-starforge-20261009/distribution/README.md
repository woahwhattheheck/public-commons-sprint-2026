# Starforge merchant toolkit

An installable distribution of the maintained Stellar x402 seller, buyer and
operator workflows. One local package supplies a merchant workspace, the original
seller and operations dashboard, OpenAPI import, buyer review and execution,
response downloads, challenge capture, and private support export.

The package preserves the original source paths and bytes. Its command interface
starts those modules directly. It contains no alternative payment implementation,
install hooks, test suites or GitHub Actions configuration.

## Install the source archive

Use Node 22.16 or later. From a new application directory, install the supplied
`tokenjunkielabs-starforge-merchant-*.tgz` archive:

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts --offline --omit=optional /absolute/path/to/the-package.tgz
npx --no-install starforge doctor
```

This is a local npm-compatible source distribution. It is marked `private` to
prevent an accidental registry publish; local installation and `npm pack` work
normally. This source-only installation omits optional packages. PostgreSQL
drivers and native payment packages have their own setup below.
Git and a Commons checkout are unnecessary on the merchant's machine.

## Start a merchant workspace

```sh
npx --no-install starforge init --dir ./merchant --template dataset
npx --no-install starforge run --workspace ./merchant -- --port 0
```

Two original startup lines report the seller and operations dashboard addresses.
The dashboard uses an available port unless `--operations-port PORT` is supplied
before `--`. The seller exposes its native `/_seller/docs` explorer,
`/_seller/openapi.json`, `/_seller/health`, `/_seller/offers`, and `/dataset`.

The starter uses the original SF30 example with deliberately nonpayable testnet
asset and recipient markers. An unpaid `/dataset` request returns the actual
native challenge-only `402` response. Change `merchant/data/catalog.json` to your
JSON dataset and restart to load the new snapshot. The data is not released by
challenge-only mode.

`init` requires a new directory and will not overwrite a previous workspace. It
creates ordinary editable `seller.json`, the selected application files, a small
`workspace.json` descriptor, and `.private/` for operator material. The starter's
README records its actual command. It does not copy the installed toolkit into
each workspace.

### Other application templates

| Template | Application source | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dataset` | `data/catalog.json` | An existing JSON data product, snapshotted by the original seller |
| `application` | `application.mjs` | A trusted Node handler, invoked by the original seller lifecycle |
| `upstream` | `upstreams.json` | An existing API, with original allowlisted query/header bindings |

For example:

```sh
npx --no-install starforge init --dir ./api-pilot --template upstream
# Edit api-pilot/upstreams.json to name your existing backend.
npx --no-install starforge run --workspace ./api-pilot -- \
  --port 0 --allow-loopback-upstream
```

The bundled upstream example points to an operator-owned loopback backend at
port 8425. No backend is invented or started for it. Use the original upstream
configuration and flags for your own HTTPS service.

## An existing PostgreSQL database

The distribution includes the original database source and its merchant workspace.
Production driver versions are derived from the same source commit's
`sf30-seller-sdk/postgres/package.json`, and are declared as optional runtime
dependencies of the archive. Development-only database fixtures are not runtime
dependencies. For this source revision, install the drivers in your application:

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts pg@8.23.1 pg-cursor@2.22.1
npx --no-install starforge doctor --postgres
npx --no-install starforge postgres-init --directory ./database-merchant
```

Configure the existing connection environment and TLS policy in
`database-merchant/source.json`, then open the maintained workspace:

```sh
npx --no-install starforge postgres-workspace \
  --source ./database-merchant/source.json --output ./merchant-packages
```

Select the actual table/view, public columns, typed filters, ordering and merchant
terms. Each reviewed export creates a new private directory. Start those exact
files through the original seller:

```sh
npx --no-install starforge postgres \
  --source /absolute/export/source.json --config /absolute/export/service.json
```

`postgres-inspect --source FILE --describe` reviews the declared query contract;
`--preflight` checks it against the existing database. The original PostgreSQL
guide and `postgres/workspace/README.md` describe role, certificate, capped-query
and facilitator setup. `doctor --postgres` checks the source manifest's actual
production imports, including a source checkout with drivers installed in the
original postgres directory. It does not connect to the database. This check is
independent of `--native`, so database setup does not require payment packages.

## Native payment dependencies

For an actual payment-capable seller, install the native packages in the same
application directory:

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts \
  @x402/core@2.28.0 @x402/stellar@2.28.0 @x402/extensions@2.28.0 \
  '@stellar/stellar-sdk@^16.3.0'
npx --no-install starforge doctor --native
npx --no-install starforge run --workspace ./merchant -- \
  --facilitator https://your-facilitator.example/facilitator
```

Replace the example payment identity in `seller.json` with your own verified
asset, recipient and exact atomic-unit prices before native operation. The
original `createNativeSellerServer` and configured facilitator own verification,
settlement, cancellation and response release. Existing request and response
limits apply unchanged.

The x402 pins are the original seller's accepted versions. The SDK peer range
matches the published dependency of
[`@x402/stellar@2.28.0`](https://registry.npmjs.org/@x402%2fstellar/2.28.0).
`doctor` checks local module resolution, Node, and Python availability; it neither
initializes a facilitator nor verifies a network transaction. The approved buyer
retains its original POSIX Python/TTY operator, private policy and journal,
trusted signer module, independent payer and chain-reconciliation requirements.

## Use all maintained commands

Arguments after a command go unchanged to its original entrypoint. Native
commands retain their own option validation, output, exit status and help. The
launcher forwards shutdown signals to the original child; it does not restart
or automatically retry a request.

| Command | Original workflow |
| --- | --- |
| `starforge seller` | SF30 JSON or application seller |
| `starforge upstream` | SF30 existing-API seller |
| `starforge operations` | SF30 seller plus live operations dashboard |
| `starforge dataset` | SF30 dataset API compilation |
| `starforge postgres` | Original PostgreSQL query seller and operations console |
| `starforge postgres-init` | Create-only original PostgreSQL source/service starter |
| `starforge postgres-inspect` | Original declaration, schema preflight or query inspection |
| `starforge postgres-workspace` | Existing database metadata to selected-query merchant package |
| `starforge openapi` | SF61 OpenAPI offer and service configuration |
| `starforge pilot` | SF96 original SF82 seller pilot, dashboard and SF93 support composition |
| `starforge buyer` | SF88 discovery, saved-source preparation, offline review and approved execution |
| `starforge capture` | SF85 original single HTTP 402 capture |
| `starforge handoff` | SF96 captured challenge to original buyer review files |
| `starforge support` | SF93 private seller and operations support export |

For example, review an existing original buyer configuration without signing:

```sh
npx --no-install starforge buyer --review --config /absolute/private/operator.json
npx --no-install starforge source
```

`source` prints the exact source commit, original Git object and SHA-256 for each
packaged file, component inventory, archive version and optional dependency
declarations. It does not infer a grant submission, merchant onboarding, customer
payment, or settlement from installation or an HTTP response.

## Embed in an application

```js
import { readSellerConfig, startSellerService, startSellerOperations }
  from '@tokenjunkielabs/starforge-merchant';

const config = await readSellerConfig('./merchant/seller.json');
const seller = await startSellerService({ config, port: 0 });
const operations = await startSellerOperations(seller, { port: 0 });
console.log({ seller: seller.url, dashboard: operations.url });
// Retain both original close functions in the application's shutdown handler.
```

Public subpaths expose the original seller compiler, HTTP adapter, native
factory, operations server, buyer client and its TypeScript declarations,
public buyer transport, response-file writer, operator bridge and support
capture. See `package.json` exports. No global configuration or source rewrite
is needed.

## Maintainers: produce an immutable distribution

Commit the distribution sources in a current public sprint checkout, then run:

```sh
node stellar/scf-starforge-20261009/distribution/build.mjs \
  --out /absolute/new-release-directory --ref HEAD
```

This packaging command needs Node, npm and Git. It reads only the chosen commit
through Git, independently of modified or untracked worktree files. It copies
explicit product components and their required shared schema/Python modules,
checks declared entrypoints and literal relative ESM dependencies, and runs
`npm pack --ignore-scripts`. The source commit determines the package version.
The new output directory contains the archive, its SHA-256/SRI receipt, and the
inspectable staged package. The builder never runs a suite, contacts a merchant,
publishes to npm, changes the source checkout, or enables hosted CI.

Concurrent source work is preserved: choose the merged commit you intend to
distribute. A later native component release becomes a new archive and source
manifest; an existing archive is not silently rewritten. The package preserves
all included native licensing and the repository's MIT license.
